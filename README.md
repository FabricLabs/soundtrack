[soundtrack.io][soundtrack] is a collaborative online radio, almost like a jukebox for the Internet.

### Vote on what plays next, like Reddit for music.
The "Queue" shows all requested tracks, ordered by oldest first.  Upvote or downvote a track to add your vote, pushing it to the top or the bottom as per your preference.

### Reliable Streams
Soundtrack aggregates streams from sources like YouTube and SoundCloud, so when a song is queued, it has multiple locations to play from if any one source fails for any particular reason.

### Earn Bitcoin
Help others with reliability by hosting streams, earning Bitcoin in exchange for your node's work.  Deposit and withdraw using normal Bitcoin addresses, compatible with all major wallets.

## Quick Start
1. `npm install -g FabricLabs/soundtrack`
2. `soundtrack`

## Configuration
Supply environment variables `FABRIC_PORT` and/or `FABRIC_SEED` for Fabric
peer-to-peer communication and persistent storage, respectively.

## Earning Bitcoin
Income can only be generated for online nodes, through an opt-in program.

To enable earning, be sure to provide `FABRIC_SEED` with a mnemonic and use:

```
$ soundtrack --earn
```

Be sure to back up your keys — we are not responsble for any losses!

## Special Thanks
Based on ideas from @chrisinajar's `hivemind` project on the original turntable.fm, we've assembled a developer-friendly API that is free for everyone to use (that's free as is freedom, not as in free beer).  Credit to @gordonwritescode for solving most of the distributed systems problems, @chjj for authoring `blessed`, and @melnx for endless testing & debugging.
