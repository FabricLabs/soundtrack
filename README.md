soundtrack.io is a collaborative online jukebox.  It is an experimental Internet radio platform.  Vote on what plays next, like Reddit for music.  Aggregates streams from sources like YouTube and SoundCloud, so when a song is queued, it has multiple locations to play from if any one source fails for any particular reason.

## Getting Started

Before you begin you will need to have nodejs, redis, and mongodb installed.
Homebrew is recommended for OS X users.

    brew install nodejs mongodb redis
    redis-server &
    mongod &

Once you have them installed, go ahead and clone the repository.

    git clone git@github.com:martindale/soundtrack.io.git
    cd soundtrack.io

Ruby and ruby-dev are required as part of the scss compilation.

    gem install sass
    gem install compass

You will need to fetch the dependencies and then you can start up the server.

    npm install
    npm install -g grunt-cli
    node soundtrack.js

## API

Deleting tracks:
`$.ajax('/playlist/520e6bda3cb680003700049c', { type: 'DELETE', data: { index: 1 } });`
