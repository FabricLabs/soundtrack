soundtrack.io is a collaborative online jukebox.  It is an experimental Internet radio platform.  Vote on what plays next, like Reddit for music.  Aggregates streams from sources like YouTube and SoundCloud, so when a song is queued, it has multiple locations to play from if any one source fails for any particular reason.

## Quick Start
1. `npm install -g FabricLabs/soundtrack`
2. `soundtrack`

## Configuration
Supply environment variables `FABRIC_PORT` and/or `FABRIC_SEED` for Fabric
peer-to-peer communication and persistent storage, respectively.

## Earning Bitcoin
Income can only be generated for online nodes, through an opt-in program.

To enable earning, be sure to provide `FABRIC_SEED` with a mnemonic and use:

```
$ soundtrack --earn
```

Be sure to back up your keys â€” we are not responsble for any losses!
